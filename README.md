# Runescape Store CLI Application 

## Introduction 
Hello readers, this is my first CLI application and it is based off the popular MMORPG Old School Runescape! This program will allow you to create a general store that holds specific items that you would find the world of gielinor. This program allows a user to create a store/shop along with populating them with various items!

## How to use it
1. In your termial enter: $ python lib/cli.py
2. You will get a prompt that states "Welcome to the general store of Gielinor!" followed by 8 different options you can use.
3. Now the best way to go about creating your stores in Runescape is to start by using option 5: "Add new shop". You will then be asked to enter a Shop Name, Location, and a Owner. It will be given an ID that you can check by using option 8: "List ALL Shops and Items". The ID's will be given in incremental order from when you created the shop starting with 1.
4. Next add the desired items you think the particular should sell using option 1: "Add New Item"! You will be asked to enter an Item Name, Item Description, Item Price, and lastly a shop ID. It is very Important to know the ID of the shop so you can correctly store the items in the right shop!
5. Lastly use option 8 when you finished to get a list of all the shops and items assciotated with the shop.
